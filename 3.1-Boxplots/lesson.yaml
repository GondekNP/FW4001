  Output: Welcome to Pre-lab 3! In the last lab section, you focused mainly on plotting categorical data. Lab 3 involves analysis of mostly quantitative data, so we're going to look at a couple of the ways we can visualize quantitative data in Pre-lab 3.1.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Let's just make sure we know the difference between categorical variables and quantitative variables. Which of the following is a quantitative variable?
  AnswerChoices: Temperature;Month;Observer;Species
  CorrectAnswer: Temperature
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= 'Temperature')
  Hint: Consider which of the options is a measurable quantity. For example, Month is limited to one in 12 options, where each month is just different, not greater or lesser than any other - not quantifiable.

  Output: Another pre-lab, another dataset. This time, we're going to look at the nutritional contents of breakfast cereal (the 'Cereal' dataset in Lock5Data).

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Though we could preview this dataset by clicking on its name in our workspace (the upper right hand panel), we're going to preview it using the head() function instead. This function has the advantage of working properly when 'knitted' in an Rmd file (which is what you do after completing lab), so it's a good habit to have! Try it now - use the function head() with the name of the dataset inside of the parentheses.
  CorrectAnswer: head(Cereal)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='head(Cereal)')
  Hint: We can look in the workspace (upper right pane) to see what the data is called - in this case, it's called Cereal. All we need to do is put that word inside of the head() function. Enter - head(Cereal)

- Class: text_question
  Output: You'll see that R prints out the first six lines of the data frame for us. Besides the name of the cereal (Name), which is the only other categorical variable in this data set?
  CorrectAnswer: Company
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Company')
  Hint: Which are quantifiable and which are simply different categories? For instance, Sodium is quantitative because it is easily quantifiable - 408 grams of sodium is always more Sodium than 143 grams. On the contrary, with the Names variable, AppleJacks is not more Name than Cap'n Crunch! That doesn't make sense, because the Name of a cereal is not quantifiable - they're just different. 

- Class: text
  Output: Let's imagine we have a question about the cereal in this dataset. Is there a difference in average calories per serving between the cereals of each company?

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: To accomplish this, we need to look at the variable Calories versus the variable Company. One is quantitative, and one is categorical. In that case, we'll use a box-and-whisker plot. Even though you probably haven't made one of these yet, the setup is similar to most other plots - goal(y~x, data=mydata). Try this now - bwplot(Calories~Company, data=Cereal)
  CorrectAnswer: bwplot(Calories~Company, data=Cereal)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='bwplot(Calories~Company, data=Cereal)')
  Hint: Enter this -  bwplot(Calories~Company, data=Cereal)

- Class: text
  Output: Looks like they might be slightly different, but their ranges overlap quite a bit. We wouldn't be able to make a decision anyways without using an ANOVA test, which you'll learn about later. However, a box and whisker plot is a useful way to do some exploratory data analysis.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's make one more box-and-whisker plot - Try it yourself, modifying your previous code, to look at Sodium between the different companies!
  CorrectAnswer: bwplot(Sodium~Company, data=Cereal)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='bwplot(Sodium~Company, data=Cereal)')
  Hint: Not much needs to change from the last bit of code we ran. Since we're now looking at Sodium instead of Calories, we just need to swap those two.

- Class: figure
  Output: Good work! You've completed Pre-Lab 3.1. An 8-digit code will appear in the console below - enter this code into the appropriate quiz on moodle in order to receive credit.
