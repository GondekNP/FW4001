  Output: Welcome to Pre-lab 3! In the last lab section, you focused mainly on plotting categorical data. Lab 3 involves analysis of mostly quantitative data, so we're going to look at a couple of the ways we can visualize quantitative data in Pre-lab 3.1.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Let's just make sure we know the difference between categorical variables and quantitative variables. Which of the following is a quantitative variable?
  AnswerChoices: Temperature;Month;Observer;Species
  CorrectAnswer: Temperature
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= 'Temperature')
  Hint: Consider which of the options is a measurable quantity. For example, Month is limited to one in 12 options, where each month is just different, not greater or lesser than any other - not quantifiable.

- Class: figure
  Output: Another pre-lab, another dataset. This time, we're going to look at the nutritional contents of breakfast cereal (the 'Cereal' dataset in Lock5Data).
  Figure: cereal.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Though we could preview this dataset by clicking on its name in our workspace (the upper right hand panel), we're going to preview it using the head() function instead. This function has the advantage of working properly when 'knitted' in an Rmd file (which is what you do after completing lab), so it's good to get into the habit of using head() to explore datasets! Try it now - use the function head() with the name of the dataset (i.e., Cereal) inside of the parentheses.
  CorrectAnswer: head(Cereal)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='head(Cereal)')
  Hint: We can look in the workspace (upper right panel) to see what the data is called - in this case, it's called Cereal. All we need to do is put that word inside of the head() function. Enter - head(Cereal).  REMEMBER, R is case sensitive!

- Class: text_question
  Output: You'll see that R prints out the first six lines of the data frame for us. Besides the name of the cereal (Name), which is the only other categorical variable in this data set?
  CorrectAnswer: Company
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Company')
  Hint: Which variables are quantifiable and which are used to simply represent different categories? For instance, Sodium is quantitative because it is easily quantifiable - 408 grams of sodium is always more Sodium than 143 grams. On the contrary, with the Names variable, AppleJacks is not more Name than Cap'n Crunch! That doesn't make sense, because the Name of a cereal is not quantifiable - they're just different. 

- Class: text
  Output: Let's imagine we have a question about the cereal in this dataset. Is there a difference in average calories per serving between the cereals made by each of the 3 companies?

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: To accomplish this task, we need to look at the variable Calories versus the variable Company. One is quantitative, and one is categorical. In this case, we'll use a box-and-whisker plot (also referred to as a boxplot). Even though you probably haven't made one of these yet, the setup is similar to most other plots - goal(y~x, data=mydata). Try this now - bwplot(Calories~Company, data=Cereal)
  CorrectAnswer: bwplot(Calories~Company, data=Cereal)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='bwplot(Calories~Company, data=Cereal)')
  Hint: Enter this -  bwplot(Calories~Company, data=Cereal)

- Class: text
  Output: Looks like the median number of calories may differ slightly for the cereals made by these 3 companies, but the ranges overlap quite a bit. We'll learn in Chapter 8 how to determine if these differences are statistically significant. For now, however, a box and whisker plot is a useful way to do some exploratory data analysis.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's make one more box-and-whisker plot - Try it yourself, modifying your previous code.  Explore whether the Sodium content differs among the different companies!
  CorrectAnswer: bwplot(Sodium~Company, data=Cereal)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='bwplot(Sodium~Company, data=Cereal)')
  Hint: Not much needs to change from the last bit of code we ran. Since we're now looking at Sodium instead of Calories, we just need to swap those two.

- Class: mult_question
