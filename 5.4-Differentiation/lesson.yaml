- Class: cmd_question
  Output: For this last section, we'll use a dataset describing the length of fictional fish in one of two lakes - Knoll Lake and Snowmass Lake. Click on the dataset LakeData in your workspace to take a look.
  CorrectAnswer: View(LakeData)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='View(LakeData)')
  Hint: Click on LakeData.
 
- Class: text_question
  Output: Now, let's say that I want to create a bootstrap distribution of the difference in means between the two lakes. What function should go in the blank? BootDist<-do(1000)*{diffmean(len~lake, data=______(LakeData))
  CorrectAnswer: resample
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='resample')
  Hint: It will either be resample or shuffle. Which do we use for bootstrapping?

- Class: text_question
  Output: Lastly, I want to create a randomization distribution of a situation where the lake had no influence on the size of fish. What would I fill the blank with? RandDist<-do(1000)*{diffmean(len~______(lake), data=LakeData)
  CorrectAnswer: shuffle
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='shuffle')
  Hint: It will either be resample or shuffle. Which do we use for randomization?
