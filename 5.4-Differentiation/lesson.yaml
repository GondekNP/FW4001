- Class: figure
  Output: In this section, I'll be presenting you with either distribution plots or fragments of code. Your job will be to discern whether they're randomization distributions, bootstrap distributions, or whether they could be either. 
  Figure: FishData.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: For this last section, we'll use a dataset describing the length of fictional fish in one of two lakes - Knoll Lake and Snowmass Lake. Click on the dataset LakeData in your workspace to take a look.
  CorrectAnswer: View(LakeData)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='View(LakeData)')
  Hint: Click on LakeData.

- Class: figure
  Output: We'll start out with our histograms of our distributions - here is the first.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Alright, go ahead - is this a randomization distribution, bootstrap distribution, or could it be either?
  AnswerChoices: randomization;bootstrap;either
  CorrectAnswer: bootstrap
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='bootstrap')
  Hint: What can we typically say if our distribution is not centered at zero?

- Class: text
  Output: Right - this is a bootstrap distribution. We can say that because it is NOT centered at zero, and because we are looking at a spread of mean values for one variable (only Knoll Lake). 

- Class: figure
  Output: Here's the next one!

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Is this a randomization distribution, bootstrap distribution, or could it be either?
  AnswerChoices: randomization;bootstrap;either
  CorrectAnswer: bootstrap
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='bootstrap')
  Hint: What can we typically say if our distribution is not centered at zero?

- Class: text
  Output: This one is a little trickier - we are looking at a diffmean here, so it could be a randomization distribution if it were centered at zero, but it is not.

- Class: figure
  Output: One more.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Imagine that you DO NOT know the calculated difference in fish length means between the two lakes. is this a randomization distribution, bootstrap distribution, or could it be either?
  AnswerChoices: randomization;bootstrap;either
  CorrectAnswer: either
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='either')
  Hint: This is very tricky. If we don't know the calculated difference in means, can we reject either of the options?

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Because we don't know the calculated difference in means, we can't confidently say this is a bootstrap or a randomization distribution. If I were to give you the information that the calculated difference in means is -15.6, how would your identification change?
  AnswerChoices: randomization;bootstrap;either
  CorrectAnswer: randomization
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='randomization')
  Hint: It is centered at zero, and we know that the calculated difference in means is not zero. 

- Class: text
  Output: Exactly. If it were a bootstrap, it would be centered at -15.6, but it is not. 

- Class: text_question
  Output: Now, let's say that I want to create a bootstrap distribution of the difference in means between the two lakes. What function should go in the blank? BootDist<-do(1000)*{diffmean(len~lake, data=______(LakeData))
  CorrectAnswer: resample
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='resample')
  Hint: It will either be resample or shuffle. Which do we use for bootstrapping?

- Class: text_question
  Output: Lastly, I want to create a randomization distribution of a situation where the lake had no influence on the size of fish. What would I fill the blank with? RandDist<-do(1000)*{diffmean(len~______(lake), data=LakeData)
  CorrectAnswer: shuffle
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='shuffle')
  Hint: It will either be resample or shuffle. Which do we use for randomization?
