- Class: figure
  Output: This will be a relatively short section, testing your ability to recall the key functions in R for creating bootstrap and randomization distributions and also your understanding of bootstrap and randomization distributions.
  Figure: FishData.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: For this last section, we'll use a dataset describing the length of fictional fish in one of two lakes - Knoll Lake and Snowmass Lake. Click on the dataset LakeData in your workspace to take a look.
  CorrectAnswer: View(LakeData)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='View(LakeData)')
  Hint: Click on LakeData.
 
- Class: text_question
  Output: Now, let's say that I want to create a bootstrap distribution of the difference in means between the two lakes. What function should go in the blank? BootDist<-do(1000)*{diffmean(len~lake, data=______(LakeData))
  CorrectAnswer: resample
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='resample')
  Hint: It will either be resample or shuffle. Which do we use for bootstrapping?

- Class: text_question
  Output: Now, say I want to create a randomization distribution to test the null hypothesis that the average size of fish is the same in both lakes.  To generate a range of likely values for the difference in mean size if this Null Hypothesis is true, what would I fill the blank in with? RandDist<-do(1000)*{diffmean(len~______(lake), data=LakeData)
  CorrectAnswer: shuffle
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='shuffle')
  Hint: It will either be resample or shuffle. Which do we use for randomization?
  
- Class: figure
  Output: OK. Consider the bootstrap distribution (lower right hand plot window).  We collected data on 20 fish in Knoll Lake.  This is a bootstrap distribution with 1000 bootstrap sample means for Knoll Lake.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: If our original sample size included 100 fish instead of 20, what would you expect to see?
  AnswerChoices: The bootstrap sample means would have more variability; The variability in the bootstrap sample means would be about the same; The bootstrap sample means would have less variability
  CorrectAnswer: The bootstrap sample means would have less variability
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='The bootstrap sample means would have less variability')
  Hint: With more data, would we expect our sample means to vary more or less?

- Class: mult_question
  Output: If we had created 10,000 bootstrap sample means rather than 1000, what would you expect to see?
  AnswerChoices: The bootstrap sample means would have more variability; The variability in the bootstrap sample means would be about the same; The bootstrap sample means would have less variability
  CorrectAnswer: The variability in the bootstrap sample means would be about the same
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='The variability in the bootstrap sample means would be about the same')
  Hint: Can you think of a reason why the distribution of bootstrap means would change?  I can't.
