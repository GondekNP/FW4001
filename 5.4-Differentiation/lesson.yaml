- Class: figure
  Output: This will be a relatively short section, testing your ability to recall the key functions in R for creating bootstrap and randomization distributions and also your understanding of bootstrap and randomization distributions.
  Figure: FishData.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: For this last section, we'll use a dataset describing the length of fictional fish in one of two lakes - Knoll Lake and Snowmass Lake. Click on the dataset LakeData in your workspace to take a look.
  CorrectAnswer: View(LakeData)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='View(LakeData)')
  Hint: Click on LakeData.
 
- Class: text_question
  Output: Now, let's say that I want to create a bootstrap distribution of the difference in means between the two lakes. What function should go in the blank? BootDist<-do(1000)*{diffmean(len~lake, data=______(LakeData))
  CorrectAnswer: resample
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='resample')
  Hint: It will either be resample or shuffle. Which do we use for bootstrapping?

- Class: text_question
  Output: Now, say I want to create a randomization distribution to test the null hypothesis that the average size of fish is the same in both lakes.  To generate a range of likely values for the difference in mean size if this Null Hypothesis is true, what would I fill the blank in with? RandDist<-do(1000)*{diffmean(len~______(lake), data=LakeData)
  CorrectAnswer: shuffle
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='shuffle')
  Hint: It will either be resample or shuffle. Which do we use for randomization?
  
- Class: figure
  Output: OK. Consider the bootstrap distribution (lower right hand plot window).  We collected data on 20 fish in Knoll Lake.  This is a bootstrap distribution with 1000 bootstrap sample means for Knoll Lake.   
  Figure: f1.R
  FigureType: new 

- Class: mult_question
  Output: If our original sample size included 100 fish instead of 20, what would you expect to see?
  AnswerChoices: The bootstrap sample means would have more variability; The variability in the bootstrap sample means would be about the same; The bootstrap sample means would have less variability
  CorrectAnswer: The bootstrap sample means would have less variability
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='The bootstrap sample means would have less variability')
  Hint: With more data, would we expect our sample means to vary more or less?

- Class: mult_question
  Output: If we had created 10,000 bootstrap sample means rather than 1000, what would you expect to see?
  AnswerChoices: The bootstrap sample means would have more variability; The variability in the bootstrap sample means would be about the same; The bootstrap sample means would have less variability
  CorrectAnswer: The variability in the bootstrap sample means would be about the same
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='The variability in the bootstrap sample means would be about the same')
  Hint: Can you think of a reason why the distribution of bootstrap means would change?  I can't.

- Class: figure
  Output: Consider the following randomization distribution used to test the null hypothesis that the average size of fish is the same in Knoll Lake and Snowmass Lake. 
  Figure: f3.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: mult_question
  Output: If the difference in our sample means is 10.2, what would we conclude when using a significance level of 0.05?
  AnswerChoices: Reject the Null Hypothesis (we have significant evidence to suggest the population means differ); Fail to reject the Null Hypothesis (we DO NOT have significant evidence to suggest the population means differ)
  CorrectAnswer: Reject the Null Hypothesis (we have significant evidence to suggest the population means differ)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Reject the Null Hypothesis (we have significant evidence to suggest the population means differ)')
  Hint: Is our sample statistic extreme compared to the values in the randomization distribution?


- Class: mult_question
  Output: Let's say you calculate a p-value for this test and it is 0.002.  What does this p-value? 
  AnswerChoices: the probability that the null hypothesis is true; 	the probability that the alternative hypothesis is true; the probability, when the null hypothesis is true, of obtaining a sample as extreme as (or more extreme than) the observed sample; the probability, when the alternative hypothesis is true, of obtaining a sample as extreme as (or more extreme than) the observed sample
  CorrectAnswer: the probability, when the null hypothesis is true, of obtaining a sample as extreme as (or more extreme than) the observed sample
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='the probability, when the null hypothesis is true, of obtaining a sample as extreme as (or more extreme than) the observed sample')
  Hint: Remember, the randomization distribution is used to determine the range of statistics we might see *if the Null Hypothesis is true*!
