  Output: Welcome to Pre-lab 9.2. In this pre-lab, we will explore plots used to evaluate the assumptions of linear regression.  

- Class: figure
  Output: Lets start with our model relating temperature change to meal size in rattlesnakes.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "OK, lets look again at the summary of our fitted model.  Type: summary(snake.lm)" 
  CorrectAnswer: summary(snake.lm)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='summary(snake.lm)')
  Hint: Enter -  summary(snake.lm)


- Class: mult_question
  Output: Lets consider the assumptions of linear regression.  Which of the items below is NOT one of our assumptions?
  AnswerChoices: the variance about the line is constant; the errors (distances between the points and the line) are normally distributed; the average temperature change at any given value of meal size falls on the line; the spread of the points about the line should increase with meal.size; the cases are independent from one another 
  CorrectAnswer: the spread of the points about the line should increase with meal.size
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='the spread of the points about the line should increase with meal.size')
  Hint:  What do we assume about the spread about the line?
