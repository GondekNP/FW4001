  Output: Welcome to Pre-lab 9.2. In this pre-lab, we will explore plots used to evaluate the assumptions of linear regression. 
    from the abd library.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "OK, lets look again at the summary of our fitted model.  Type: summary(snake.lm)" 
  CorrectAnswer: summary(snake.lm)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='summary(snake.lm)')
  Hint: Enter -  summary(snake.lm)


- Class: mult_question
  Output: Lets consider the assumptions of linear regression.  Which of the items below is NOT one of our assumptions?
  AnswerChoices: the variance about the line is constant; the errors (distances between the points and the line) are normally distributed; the average temperature change at any given value of meal size falls on the line; the spread of the points about the line should increase with meal.size; the cases are independent from one another 
  CorrectAnswer: the spread of the points about the line should increase with meal.size
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='the spread of the points about the line should increase with meal.size')
  Hint:  What do we assume about the spread about the line?

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "R has some built in plots for exploring these assumptions. First, lets set up the plotting window so we can see 4 plots at a time.  We can do this by typing par(mfrow=c(2,2)).  This tells R that you want to plot in multiple frames, by row, with 2 rows and 2 columns. Go ahead and type: par(mfrow=c(2,2))" 
  CorrectAnswer: par(mfrow=c(2,2))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='par(mfrow=c(2,2))')
  Hint: Enter -  par(mfrow=c(2,2))
   
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Now, we can type plot(name of linear regression object).  In this case, try typing: summary(snake.lm)" 
  CorrectAnswer: plot(snake.lm)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='plot(snake.lm)')
  Hint: Enter -  plot(snake.lm)   
  
- Class: text
  Output: Probably the two most useful plots are the two on the top row.  In the top left plot, we are looking
    to make sure the residuals do not exhibit a strong pattern.  We also hope that the spread of the residuals is similar across the range of x values.
    The number of observations here is small, so it is difficult to say too much, but I would say this plot looks "OK".  Also note that there is one large outlier (marked with a 17, indicating it is the 17th observation in the data set).  
  
- Class: text
  Output: The top right plot is called a QQ plot and is used to evaluate the normality assumption.  We are looking for observations to fall roughly on the line. I would say things look "OK" here as well.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now, let's look at another example with more data - specifically, the StudentSurvey dataset we used in week 1 (you've come full circle).  Click on StudentSurvey.
  CorrectAnswer: View(StudentSurvey)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='View(StudentSurvey)')
  Hint: Click on StudentSurvey in the workspace.
    
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We'll look at whether a model using GPA is a good predictor for SAT scores. Before we fit a model to the data, let's just take a look at the scatterplot - xyplot(SAT~GPA,StudentSurvey)
  CorrectAnswer: xyplot(SAT~GPA,StudentSurvey)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='xyplot(SAT~GPA,StudentSurvey)')
  Hint: Enter -  xyplot(SAT~GPA,StudentSurvey)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Now, try using lm() to create a linear model, using GPA as a predictor for SAT. This time, save it into an object called SAT.GPA. Enter: SAT.GPA <- lm(SAT~GPA,StudentSurvey)"
  CorrectAnswer: SAT.GPA<-lm(SAT~GPA,StudentSurvey)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='SAT.GPA<-lm(SAT~GPA,StudentSurvey)')
  Hint: "Enter: SAT.GPA <- lm(SAT~GPA,StudentSurvey)" 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Great, now print out a summary of the fitted model using summary(SAT.GPA) 
  CorrectAnswer: summary(SAT.GPA)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='summary(SAT.GPA)')
  Hint: Enter - summary(SAT.GPA)


- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Now, we can again look at diagnostic plots by typing: plot(SAT.GPS)." 
  CorrectAnswer: plot(SAT.GPA)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='plot(SAT.GPS)')
  Hint: Enter -  plot(SAT.GPA)   


- Class: mult_question
  Output: Based on the uppper left plot, do you think the assumption of constant variance is reasonable?
  AnswerChoices: Yes; No
  CorrectAnswer: Yes
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Yes')
  Hint:  Do the residuals look to be equally spread out as you move along the x-axis?
    

- Class: mult_question
  Output: YEs, the residuals look equally spread out as you move along the x-axis.  Based on the uppper right plot, do you think the normality assumption is reasonable?
  AnswerChoices: Yes; No
  CorrectAnswer: Yes
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Yes')
  Hint:  Do the dots fall along the line?
  
- class: text
  Output:  Yes, the dots fall on the line. The assumptions look like they are reasonably met!
