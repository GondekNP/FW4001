  Output: Let's add our interval to the histogram of bootstrap means to see where our interval falls relative to the rest of the bootstrap distribution. This time, we will plot the bootstrap means, and add vertical lines at our lower and upper confidence interval values. Try it - histogram(~result, data=CaffBoot, v=c(Hi,Lo))
  CorrectAnswer: histogram(~result, data=CaffBoot, v=c(Hi,Lo))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='histogram(~result, data=CaffBoot, v=c(Hi,Lo))')
  Hint: Enter - histogram(~result, data=CaffBoot, v=c(Hi,Lo))

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Consider the histogram and 95% confidence interval.  Which of the following is a plausabile value for the parameter (the true mean tap rate for caffeinated students)?  
  AnswerChoices: 246.6;247.9;252.0
  CorrectAnswer: 247.9
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='247.9')
  Hint: Which value is between the black lines?

- Class: text
  Output: It is important to understand that this confidence interval is influenced by our choice of confidence level (i.e., by how confident we want to be that our interval contains the population parameter!). By choosing to report a 95% confidence interval, we expect to be right 19 out of 20 times (meaning that only 1 interval out of 20 should NOT contain the true parameter).
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's look at what happens to our interval if we want to be MORE confident - instead of a 95% interval, let's calculate a 99.9% interval. This time, we will have R calculate the interval for us directly from the bootstrap distribution using the confint() function. Try this - HighConfidence<-confint(CaffBoot, level=.999)
  CorrectAnswer: HighConfidence<-confint(CaffBoot, level=.999)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='HighConfidence<-confint(CaffBoot, level=.999)')
  Hint: Enter - HighConfidence<-confint(CaffBoot, level=.999)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's look at the output. Type HighConfidence. 
  CorrectAnswer: HighConfidence
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='HighConfidence')
  Hint: Enter - HighConfidence

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now, let's plot the same histogram using this more confident interval. Enter this - histogram(~result, data=CaffBoot, v=c(HighConfidence$lower, HighConfidence$upper))
  CorrectAnswer: histogram(~result, data=CaffBoot, v=c(HighConfidence$lower, HighConfidence$upper))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='histogram(~result, data=CaffBoot, v=c(HighConfidence$lower, HighConfidence$upper))')
  Hint: Enter - histogram(~result, data=CaffBoot, v=c(HighConfidence$lower, HighConfidence$upper))

- Class: text
  Output: The 99.9% confidence interval is much wider! We are now more confident that our interval will capture the true parameter, but we pay the price of having a wider interval!

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Using a 95% confidence interval, you decided that 246.6 was not a plausible population parameter. Using this new interval, where does 246.6 fall?
  AnswerChoices: Inside the interval;Outside the interval
  CorrectAnswer: Inside the interval
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= 'Inside the interval')
  Hint: There is one bin where 246.6 would be on this histogram. Is that bin on the inside of the interval or the outside?

- Class: mult_question
  Output: What would happen if we created and plotted a 70% confidence interval? Ie - confint(CaffBoot, level=.70)
  AnswerChoices: The interval would get wider;The interval would get narrower
  CorrectAnswer: The interval would get narrower
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='The interval would get narrower')
  Hint: The 99.9% confidence interval was wider than the original 95% confidence interval. Now that we are lowering our confidence, what should happen to the interval?

- Class: text
  Output: Right - if we don't need to be too confident that our parameter is inside the interval, we will get a much narrower interval. In many contexts (for better or worse), using a 95% confidence is standard.
