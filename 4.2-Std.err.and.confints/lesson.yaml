- Class: figure
  Output: In this section, we'll look at a few ways that we can construct confidence intervals from a bootstrap distribution. We'll use the same distribution we made in 4.1, CaffBoot.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Let's think for a moment about what we're actually trying to accomplish when constructing a confidence interval. A 95% confidence interval describes what, exactly, in this case? 
  AnswerChoices: We are 95% confident that the truth (true mean tap rate for the caffeinated group) is contained in this interval.; There is a 95% chance that the truth (true mean tap rate for the caffeinated group) falls in this interval.
  CorrectAnswer: We are 95% confident that the truth (true mean tap rate for the caffeinated group) is contained in this interval.
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='We are 95% confident that the truth (true mean tap rate for the caffeinated group) is contained in this interval.')
  Hint: It's important to know that we are NOT dealing with probability here. The truth (the population parameter) is fixed, so the probability of it falling in some interval is either 0 or 1. 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: There are three important things we need for a confidence interval. The first is the statistic calculated from the original data.  So, let's save the value of the mean for the original data now. Try it - CaffMean <- mean(~Taps, data=CaffGroup)
  CorrectAnswer: CaffMean <- mean(~Taps, data=CaffGroup)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='CaffMean <- mean(~Taps, data=CaffGroup)')
  Hint: Enter - CaffMean <- mean(~Taps, data=CaffGroup)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Second, we need to calculate the standard deviation of the bootstrap distribution (in other words, the Standard Error!). Call this object CaffSD. CaffSD <- sd(~result, data=CaffBoot)
  CorrectAnswer: CaffSD <- sd(~result, data=CaffBoot)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='CaffSD <- sd(~result, data=CaffBoot)')
  Hint: Try this - CaffSD <- sd(~result, data=CaffBoot)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: For a 95% confidence interval, we can use the following formula - statistic +/- (2 * sd). In this case, our statistic is CaffMean (the mean tap rate of caffeinated individuals). Our sd is the sd we computed earlier, CaffSD. Putting it all together, let's compute the upper value of the confidence interval - Hi <- CaffMean + 2 * CaffSD
  CorrectAnswer: Hi <- CaffMean + 2 * CaffSD
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='Hi <- CaffMean + 2 * CaffSD', strict=FALSE)
  Hint: Enter - Hi <- CaffMean + 2 * CaffSD

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now, let's compute the lower bound using the same formula, subtracting the 2 * sd term instead of adding it. Save this to an object called Lo. 
  CorrectAnswer: Lo <- CaffMean - 2 * CaffSD
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='Lo <- CaffMean - 2 * CaffSD', strict=FALSE)
  Hint: Last time, we used this code - Hi <- CaffMean + 2 * CaffSD. Instead of adding, we need to subtract, and we need to call this value Lo instead of Hi. 

- Class: text
  Output: Now we have the upper and lower bound of the 95% confidence interval of interest. In the next section, we will explore how our desired level of confidence might change the size of our interval.
