  Output: Now that we've done some basic math with R, let's use some 'functions' to analyze some data. Basically, a function is an operation that does something with some information provided to it. 

- Class: text
  Output: All functions in R are followed by two parentheses. For example, mean() takes the mean of some numbers, min() finds the minimum value of some numbers, and max() finds the maximum.

- Class: figure
  Output: These functions in particular will follow a format that we will become very familiar with, eventually. This format is as follows - goal(y~x, data=mydata), where 'goal' is what we want to do with our data, and 'mydata' is the data we want to analyze.

  Output: I've put a dataset in your workspace (the top right panel) called RetailSales. To look at this table, simply click on the name RetailSales in the top right corner panel (your workspace).
  CorrectAnswer: View(RetailSales)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='View(RetailSales)')
  Hint: No need to type anything, just click the word RetailSales in the top right corner panel (your workspace).

  Output: This is a table of monthly retail sales for the US economy for each month from 2002 to 2011, in billions of dollars. Let's say, for example, we want to find the mean amount of monthly retail sales using this data. To do this, we'd follow the format from above and enter the following - mean(~Sales, data=RetailSales)
  CorrectAnswer: mean(~Sales, data=RetailSales)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='mean(~Sales, data=RetailSales)')
  Hint: R in this case will work with or without the ~, but it is best to get into the habitat of using the ~. If you received an error, type this in exactly as it appears - mean(~Sales, data=RetailSales)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: So now we see that the average monthly sales in retail are about 300 billion dollars. Let's see what the lowest amount of monthly sales was using our dataset. Using the same format, we change the function from mean() to min(). Enter the following - min(~Sales, data=RetailSales).
  CorrectAnswer: min(~Sales, data=RetailSales)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='min(~Sales, data=RetailSales)')
  Hint: Don't worry about the first part yet (~Sales), we'll get to what this means during lab. Just type this in exactly - min(~Sales, data=RetailSales)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: So the worst month of sales over the course of 2002-2011 was 214 billion dollars - still not too shabby. Now, lastly, let's find out what the best month of sales was over this time! Using the function max() and the format we used in the previous two functions, give it a try. 
  CorrectAnswer: max(~Sales, data=RetailSales)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='max(~Sales, data=RetailSales)')
  Hint: In order to get the mean, we used - mean(~Sales, data=RetailSales). To get the minimum, we used -  min(~Sales, data=RetailSales). You'll notice that nothing changes but the name of the function! This time, we're using max() instead of mean() or min().

- Class: text
  Output: Great work - We now know that over the course of 2002 and 2011, the United States averaged about 300 billion dollars in retail sales monthly, but some months were as low as 214 billion and some were as high as 394 billion!
