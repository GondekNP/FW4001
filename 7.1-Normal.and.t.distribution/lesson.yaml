  Output: Welcome to Pre-lab 7!  

- Class: text
  Output: In this pre-lab, we're going to look at the differences between a normal distribution and a t-distribution, and why the distinction matters. 

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Before we take a look at any t-distributions, what are they used for?
  AnswerChoices: To calculate CI's and p-values when making inference about a population mean or difference in means; To make an adjustment to our estimate of a population parameter if we have a small sample size
  CorrectAnswer: To calculate CI's and p-values when making inference about a population mean or difference in means
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='To calculate CI\'s and p-values when making inference about a population mean or difference in means')
  Hint: It is certainly used in cases with a small sample size, but it doesn't change our estimate of the parameter of interest. 

- Class: text
  Output: Right. The useful thing about a t-distribution is that we can use it to calculate confidence intervals and p-values when making inference about a mean or difference in means when we have small sample sizes, SO LONG AS the data are normally distributed. At large sample sizes, the t-distribution can be used, but at that point, it looks quite similar to a normal distribution.

- Class: figure
  Output: Let's take a look at the shape of a t-distribution. Like the normal distribution, it is bell-shaped and symmetric.  But, it is wider than a normal distribution.  How much wider depends on  the 'degrees of freedom' (df) associated with the t-distribution. As we will see, df is determined by the sample size.

  Output: For example, a curve with df=30 has substantially more cases in the dataset of interest than a curve with df=3. What do you notice about the curves as df decreases? You may want to click the 'Zoom' button above the plot to get a better look.
  AnswerChoices: As df decreases, the curve becomes shorter and wider;As df decreases, the curves become taller and narrower
  CorrectAnswer: As df decreases, the curve becomes shorter and wider
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='As df decreases, the curve becomes shorter and wider')
  Hint: Take a look at the difference between the red line (df=1) and the green and yellow lines (df=8, df=30).

- Class: text
  Output: Like I mentioned earlier, if you have large enough sample sizes, the t-distribution becomes approximately normal. However, at low sample sizes, the t-distribution is substantially wider and shorter than the normal distribution. This matters a great deal when we calculate confidence intervals and p-values!

- Class: text
  Output: As you already know, you can calculate the confidence interval for a statistic by using the following formula - statistic +/- z* x SE, where z* is the critical value of the normal distribution and depends on the confidence level you specify. For example, z* for a 95% confidence interval is 1.96 (although, we have used 2 as a rough approximation). When you have sufficiently large sample sizes, this works just fine. But, let's see what we get if we use a critical value from a t-distribution, t*, and also how this value might change depending on our sample size.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's confirm what we already know - when sample sizes are large, t* will be approximately 2 for a 95% confidence interval. To determine t*, we will use xqt(p= probability, df = degrees of freedom). For a 95% confidence interval, we would use p=c(0.025, 0.975).   Lets look at t* when our degrees of freedom = 50 (that is a fairly large sample size). Enter - xqt(p=c(.025,.975), df=50) 
  CorrectAnswer: xqt(p=c(.025,.975), df=50)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='xqt(p=c(.025,.975), df=50)')
  Hint: Enter - xqt(p=c(.025,.975), df=50)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Great. You should see that we got values that are quite close to 2 and -2. Let's say that, for example, we have a dataset where we determined the mean height of 51 individuals to be 70 inches with a SE of 10. What would the UPPER value of our 95% confidence interval be? You can assume t* = 2. 
  CorrectAnswer: 70 + 2*10
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('70 + 2*10', '70 + 10*2','90')
  Hint: Enter the values into the formula for a CI - statistic +/- t* * SE

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Now, let's assume that we have a similar dataset, where we have similar metrics - mean of 70, SE of 10. Let's say, however, that we have only 4 individuals in the dataset. We define df as n - 1, so we would then have 3 degrees of freedom instead of 50. What would you expect to happen to the confidence interval?
  AnswerChoices: It would get wider;It would get narrower;It wouldn't change
  CorrectAnswer: It would get wider
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='It would get wider')
  Hint: The curve itself would widen out and get shorter, so what would happen to the values at which 2.5% and 97.5% of the data fall?

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's confirm this by actually producing the new interval. First, we need to find t* using our new df value - xqt(p=c(.025,.975), df=3)
  CorrectAnswer: xqt(p=c(.025,.975), df=3)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='xqt(p=c(.025,.975), df=3)')
  Hint: Enter -  xqt(p=c(.025,.975), df=3)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now we have a t* of about 3.2, instead of 2. Let's calculate the new upper value of the interval (you can assume t* is now 3.2, mean is still 70, and SE is still 10).
  CorrectAnswer: 70 + 3.2*10
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('70 + 3.2*10', '70+10*3.2', '102')
  Hint: Use this formula - statistic +/- t* * SE

- Class: text
  Output: Instead of an interval of 50 to 90, we now have an interval of 38 to 102 - MUCH wider! Therefore, it's important to know your sample size when calculating a confidence interval for a population mean.
