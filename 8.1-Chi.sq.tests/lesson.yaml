- Class: text
  Output: Welcome to Pre-lab 8! In these two sections, we'll look at two tests for analysis of multiple groups, the chi-square test and analysis of variance (ANOVA) test.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We're going to be taking a look at another dataset from Lock5Data, in which cocaine users were treated with different treatments in an effort to prevent relapse. Click on the dataset CocaineTreatment in your workspace.
  CorrectAnswer: View(CocaineTreatment)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='View(CocaineTreatment)')
  Hint: Just click on CocaineTreatment in the top right panel. 

- Class: mult_question
  Output: What kind of variables do we have here?
  AnswerChoices: two categorical;one quantitative and one categorical;two quantitative
  CorrectAnswer: two categorical
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='two categorical')
  Hint: Are any of the variables quantifiable? 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We're looking at two categorical variables here. Since we want to know if the treatments differ in their rates of success, we will use a chi-square test for association. First, let's tally the relapses for each treatment. Type -  (CocaineTab <- tally(~Relapse|Drug, data=CocaineTreatment, format="proportion")).  NOte, the extra "( )" around the expression will print AND save tally as an object.
  CorrectAnswer: (CocaineTab <- tally(~Relapse|Drug, data=CocaineTreatment, format="proportion"))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='(CocaineTab <- tally(~Relapse|Drug, data=CocaineTreatment, format=\"proportion\"))')
  Hint: Enter - (CocaineTab <- tally(~Relapse|Drug, data=CocaineTreatment, format="proportion")), note, make sure you have the extra "(" and ")" around the expression.
 

- Class: text
  Output: Superficially, it looks like Desipramine does a better job of preventing a relapse - a larger proportion of users who  were treated with Desipramine did not relapse (when compared to the  other two treatment groups). Let's see if these differences are statistically significant. 
 
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Fundamentally, we want to compare the observed counts of each drug x relapse combination with what we'd expect if the drug used had no influence on relapse. To figure out what we'd expect, let's look at the overall proportion of relapses, regardless of treatment. Enter - tally(~Relapse, data=CocaineTreatment, format='proportion')
  CorrectAnswer: tally(~Relapse, data=CocaineTreatment, format='proportion')
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='tally(~Relapse, data=CocaineTreatment, format=\'proportion\')')
  Hint: Enter - tally(~Relapse, data=CocaineTreatment, format='proportion')
 
- Class: exact_question
  Output: So, if two thirds of users in this study relapse, and there were 24 individuals in each treatment group, how many relapses would we expect for each treatment group if there was no influence of the drug taken?
  CorrectAnswer: 16
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('16', '24*2/3', '24/3*2')
  Hint: 2/3 of users in the study relapse, and there are 24 users in each group. 24 * 2/3 = ...

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Exactly. If the null hypothesis is true (the drugs have no effect), then we expect 16 users to relapse and 8 NOT to relapse (regardless of the drug). Now, for each drug x relapse combination, we calculate a 'residual' - (observed - expected)^2 / expected. So, what is our residual for Desipramine users who relapsed? We observed 10, and we expect 16. 
  CorrectAnswer: (10-16)^2/16
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='(10-16)^2/16', correctVal='2.25')
  Hint: Remember, the formula for our residual is (Observed - Expected)^2 / Expected. 

- Class: text
  Output: So, we got 2.25 as our first residual. If you didn't have R, you'd finish up by hand, but fortunately, we can compute the rest automatically!

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Try it now using xchisq.test() - xchisq.test(tally(Relapse~Drug, data=CocaineTreatment))
  CorrectAnswer: xchisq.test(tally(Relapse~Drug, data=CocaineTreatment))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='xchisq.test(tally(Relapse~Drug, data=CocaineTreatment))')
  Hint: Enter - xchisq.test(tally(Relapse~Drug, data=CocaineTreatment))

- Class: text
  Output: Unfortunately, xchisq.test drops the names of the variables.  But, the residual you just calculated was in the first column, second row. If you look inside the brackets, you'll see the exact value you just calculated - 2.25! (Note, mosaic calls these residuals 'contribution to the X-squared', because the summation of each individual calculation is called the chi-squared statistic)

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Looking at the summary of our chisq.test(), can we say that there IS a significant association between treatment and tendency to relapse (at the 95% confidence level)? Hint - look for the p-value. 
  AnswerChoices: Yes;No
  CorrectAnswer: Yes
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Yes')
  Hint: Is p < .05?

- Class: text
  Output: Exactly - we can reject the null hypothesis that the treatment group has no association with relapse rate!

- Class: mult_question
