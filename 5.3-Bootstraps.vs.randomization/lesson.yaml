- Class: figure
  Output: In this section, we'll look at some of the differences and connections between randomization and bootstrap distributions.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Superficially, bootstrap and randomization distributions look quite similar, but it is important to know how they differ. Let's take a look at our Randomization Distribution from the last section to look at some of its features - histogram(~diffmean, data=RandDist)
  CorrectAnswer: histogram(~diffmean, data=RandDist)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='histogram(~diffmean, data=RandDist)')
  Hint: Enter - histogram(~diffmean, data=RandDist)

- Class: mult_question
  Output: One of the most important things to notice about the Randomization Distribution is where it is centered. On what value is this distribution centered?
  AnswerChoices: 0;-2;2
  CorrectAnswer: 0
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='0')
  Hint: Where is the peak of this distribution?

- Class: text
  Output: Yes!  The randomization distribution tells us what values for diffmean we are likely to see IF the null hypothesis is true.  If caffiene has NO EFFECT on tap rate, then we would expect that the difference in mean tap rate for the two groups would, on average, equal 0.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: If we had calculated a bootstrap distribution, where would this distribution have been centered? 
  AnswerChoices: 0;-3.5;2
  CorrectAnswer: -3.5
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='-3.5')
  Hint: Bootstrap distributions are centered on the sample statistic (here, the difference in mean for the original data).

- Class: figure
  Output: Yes. Bootstrap distributions are centered on the sample statistic (here, the difference in mean for the original data), which was -3.5.
  Figure: caffboot.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: I've loaded in the bootstrap distribution you made for pre-lab 4, of the mean tap rate for the Caffeine group. Let's take a look at this distribution using a histogram - the dataframe is called CaffBoot and the variable we are interested in is labeled "mean" - so, histogram(~mean, data=CaffBoot).
  CorrectAnswer: histogram(~mean, data=CaffBoot)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='histogram(~mean, data=CaffBoot)')
  Hint: We want to plot the mean values inside the data fram CaffBoot. Try using the histogram() function in a very similar fashion to the randomization distribution we plotted above. 

- Class: mult_question
  Output: On what value is this distribution centered?
  AnswerChoices: About 248.3; About 249; About 247; About 0
  CorrectAnswer: About 248.3
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='About 248.3')
  Hint: Where is the distribution the highest?

- Class: mult_question
  Output: What is special about that number, 248.3?
  AnswerChoices: It is the mean in the original dataset for the Caffeinated group; It is the difference in means between the Caffeineated group and the Non-caffeinated group
  CorrectAnswer: It is the mean in the original dataset for the Caffeinated group
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='It is the mean in the original dataset for the Caffeinated group')
  Hint: We know the difference in means is -3.5. 

- Class: text
  Output: Exactly. Remember, bootstrap distributions will be centered on our sample statistic!  

- Class: mult_question
  Output: If we want to determine plausible values for a population parameter (population mean, population proportion, population correlation coefficient, ...), which distribution would we be interested in? 
  AnswerChoices: Randomization distribution; Bootstrap Distribution
  CorrectAnswer: Bootstrap Distribution
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Bootstrap Distribution')
  Hint: Use this distribution to calculate confidence intervals! 

- Class: mult_question
  Output: If we want to determine plausible values for our statistic *If the Null Hypothesis is true**, which distribution would we be interested in? 
  AnswerChoices: Randomization Distribution; Bootstrap Distribution
  CorrectAnswer: Randomization Distribution
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Randomization Distribution')
  Hint: Use this distribution to calculate p-values!
  
- Class: text
  Output: Yes, a key difference between bootstrap distributions and randomization distributions is that the latter explores a range of values for our statistic in the case *where the null hypothesis is true**.
