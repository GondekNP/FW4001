  Output: Welcome to Pre-lab 5! In this pre-lab, we're going to perform a hypothesis test by creating a randomization distribution, and see how this differs fundamentally from bootstrapping. 

- Class: figure
  Output: We'll be using the same dataset as we had in Pre-lab 4 - CaffeineTaps. Our goal today is to answer the following question - do caffeinated students tap at a greater rate than non-caffeinated students? First, though, we're going to go through some fundamentals of hypothesis testing.

  Output: The first step in performing a hypothesis test is to come up with a pair of testable hypotheses. These are referred to as the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis. The former assumes that there that the dependent variable will have no effect whatsoever on the independent variable, and the latter assumes that there will be a discernable difference between the groups we are comparing. 

- Class: mult_question
  Output: So, which of the following is our null hypothesis for our Caffeine experiment?
  AnswerChoices: The difference in tap rate between the caffeinated and uncaffeinated groups will equal zero.;The difference in tap rate between the caffeinated and uncaffeinated groups will NOT equal zero.
  CorrectAnswer: The difference in tap rate between the caffeinated and uncaffeinated groups will equal zero.
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='The difference in tap rate between the caffeinated and uncaffeinated groups will equal zero.')
  Hint: This assumes that there is no difference between the groups we are comparing. 

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Conversely, which is the alternative hypothesis?
  AnswerChoices: The difference in tap rate between the caffeinated and uncaffeinated groups will equal zero.;The difference in tap rate between the caffeinated and uncaffeinated groups will NOT equal zero.
  CorrectAnswer: The difference in tap rate between the caffeinated and uncaffeinated groups will NOT equal zero.
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='The difference in tap rate between the caffeinated and uncaffeinated groups will NOT equal zero.')
  Hint: This hypothesis assumes that our groups are actually different!

- Class: text
  Output: You may have noticed something there. Let's break this down to two different formulas - H0 will represent the Null Hypothesis, HA will represent the Alternative Hypothesis, and diffmean will represent the difference in mean tap rates between the two groups.  

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Our two hypotheses are as follows. H0 -> diffmean = 0, HA -> diffmean =/= 0. Just by looking at these two equations, which has more possibilities of being true?
  AnswerChoices: HA;H0;They're the same
  CorrectAnswer: HA
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='HA')
  Hint: For H0 to be true, the diffmean needs to be EXACTLY zero. For HA, the diffmean can be ANYTHING that isn't zero. 

- Class: exact_question
  Output: In fact, for how many conditions of diffmean is H0 true? Remember, H0 -> diffmean = 0. 
  CorrectAnswer: 1
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='1')
  Hint: There is only one single value of diffmean where the null hypothesis is true, 0. 

- Class: text
  Output: Exactly. You might think, based solely on this, that it would simple to accept most alternative hypotheses. However, as statisticians, we assume the null hypothesis is true until we have sufficient evidence to say otherwise. That is to say, until we can argue that our observed diffmean isn't just due to random chance.

- Class: figure
  Output: In order to do this, we simulate many, many cases where the null hypothesis is TRUE, and then we see where our observed diffmean falls on that distribution.

- Class: exact_question
  Output: In the randomization distribution we just simulated, what value is the disribution approximately centered on?
  CorrectAnswer: 0
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='0')
  Hint: If we are simulating cases where the the groups don't matter (H0 is true), what should the difference in means be?

- Class: text
  Output: Exactly - in the next section, we'll learn how to produce a distribution like this one, and we'll learn how to figure out where our observed value falls.
