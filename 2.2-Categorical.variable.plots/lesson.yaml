  Lesson: 2.2 - Categorical variable plots
  Author: Nick Gondek and John Fieberg
  Type: Standard
  Organization: University of Minnesota
  Version: 2.4.2

- Class: figure
  Output: In this section, we'll try out some of the different ways that we can visualize (create informative plots of) categorical variables using the same data set as last time (StudentSurvey).
  Figure: student.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Just like the last lesson, I've put the dataset "StudentSurvey" into your workspace (the upper right panel). Let's click on the name of this dataset in order to take a look.
  CorrectAnswer: View(StudentSurvey)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='View(StudentSurvey)')
  Hint: No need to type anything into the console - just click on StudentSurvey in the upper right panel.

- Class: text
  Output: We'll consider the simple case where we only have a single categorical variable to look at. Let's say that we want to see how many of the students who took the survey are smokers (ie, 'Yes' in the Smoke variable column). 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: The mosaic package has a function, bargraph(), that allows us to use the familiar format we learned in Lab 1 - goal(y~x, data=mydata). Since we're just looking at a single variable, Smoke, we can omit a response variable (y in our 'familiar format'). Try entering bargraph(~Smoke, data=StudentSurvey) into the console. 
  CorrectAnswer: bargraph(~Smoke, data=StudentSurvey)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('bargraph(~Smoke, data=StudentSurvey)', 'bargraph(Smoke, data=StudentSurvey)')
  Hint: It probably looks weird, but we don't need anything before the ~ in our function. Just type in bargraph(~Smoke, data=StudentSurvey) to the console. 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Note that, even though the function works without a ~ in front of Smoke, you should get in the habit of using ~ in this format. Now, using that same function setup, try to compare how many students there are for each grade level - use the Year variable!
  CorrectAnswer: bargraph(~Year, data=StudentSurvey)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('bargraph(~Year, data=StudentSurvey)','bargraph(Year, data=StudentSurvey)')
  Hint: Not much has to change from our last function - bargraph(~Smoke, data=StudentSurvey). We still want a bargraph, and we still want to use the StudentSurvey data set, except this time, we want to look at the variable Year instead of Smoke. 

- Class: text
  Output: Let's try one last plot. Now, we want to look at the variable Award, which represents which of three awards the student would like to win in their lifetime - an Academy Award, a Nobel Prize, or an Olympic Medal. 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now instead of just looking at counts, like we did in the last two plots, let's look at how this breaks down between males and females. To compare between groups, we can add a single argument to our function - groups. When you set groups equal to a categorical variable in the data frame, the graph will be broken down by that variable. Let's try it - bargraph(~Award, data=StudentSurvey, groups = Gender, auto.key=TRUE). 
  CorrectAnswer: bargraph(~Award, data=StudentSurvey, groups = Gender, auto.key=TRUE)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('bargraph(~Award, data=StudentSurvey, groups = Gender, auto.key=TRUE)','bargraph(Award, data=StudentSurvey, groups = Gender, auto.key=TRUE)')
  Hint: It's a big long chunk of code, but you can enter it exactly as follows - bargraph(~Award, data=StudentSurvey, groups = Gender, auto.key=TRUE). groups tells R that we want to break down the data by Gender, and auto.key tells R that we want to generate a graph legend automatically. 

- Class: text
  Output: Great job. You may have noticed that I lied about using just one more argument - we actually used groups AND an argument called auto.key. auto.key tells R that we want it to generate a legend automatically. That way, we can actually tell which color is which Gender. 


- Class: mult_question
  Output: Good work! You've completed Pre-Lab 2.2. Please select "YES" (or "No"). Either will allow you to submit the log of this lesson to Google Forms so that I can give you credit for the pre-lab assignment.
  AnswerChoices: Yes;No
  CorrectAnswer: NULL
  AnswerTests: submit_log()
  Hint: hint
