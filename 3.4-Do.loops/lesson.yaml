- Class: text
  Output: You're probably wondering why the difference between sampling and resampling matters - well, you're in luck, because you will be finding out this week when you learn about bootstrapping! For now, we're going to look at a critical tool in R that will facillitate bootstrapping, the 'do' loop. 
  
- Class: text
  Output: Just to illustrate the power of a do loop, imagine there is a mysterious government agent who gives you 1 cent for each time you can compute 2*2 in R. You can sit there for hours typing 2*2 over and over, but surely there is a better way...

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Try this instead - do(100)*(2*2)
  CorrectAnswer: do(100)*(2*2)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='do(100)*(2*2)', strict=FALSE)
  Hint: The notation will look weird at first. Just try this out - do(100)*(2*2)

- Class: text
  Output: You'll see that using do(100)* in front of that expression quite literally 'did' it 100 times. This works for anything you put inside of the parentheses to the right. Now, you wouldn't have to go to college, because your payout is limited only by how huge you make your do loop.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's use a more realistic and less lucrative example. Just so we have something to work with, let's generate some data. We'll generate 15 numbers, pulled at random from a normal distribution (this is a bell-shaped distribution that depends on two parameters, a mean and a standard deviation - you will learn more about the normal distribution in Chapter 5!). We're going to pretend that these numbers are the canopy heights of trees in rural Panama. Enter - bigtrees<-rnorm(n=15,mean=1000,sd=200)  
  CorrectAnswer: bigtrees<-rnorm(n=15,mean=1000,sd=200)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='bigtrees<-rnorm(n=15,mean=1000,sd=200)')
  Hint: n represents the number of numbers we want, and mean and sd are the mean and sd of our normal distrubution. Enter - bigtrees<-rnorm(n=15,mean=1000,sd=200)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's take a look at these trees. Enter bigtrees in the console to see the values we got. 
  CorrectAnswer: bigtrees
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='bigtrees')
  Hint: Nothing fancy, just enter - bigtrees
  
- Class: text
  Output: Now we'll put all of that previous sampling and resampling experience to use. Let's say that we want to take the mean of a resample (note, with replacement) of our bigtrees data. Each and every time we do this, the mean is going to be slightly different, because resample is going to repeat and exclude different trees.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Calculating the mean for each of several resampled groups of observations would be really time consuming if we had to do this one by one. Fortunately, we won't have to do that, because we can use our newest tool - the do loop. Try it now by taking the mean of 10 resamples - do(10)*(mean(resample(bigtrees)))
  CorrectAnswer: do(10)*(mean(resample(bigtrees)))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='do(10)*(mean(resample(bigtrees)))')
  Hint: It's a big ugly chunk of code, make sure you have three right parentheses at the end! Enter - do(10)*(mean(resample(bigtrees)))

- Class: text
  Output: Now we have 10 different means, each slightly different than the other, because each resample of bigtrees is slightly different. 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Just for illustration, try the same code using sample instead of resample - do(10)*(mean(sample(bigtrees))). Remember, you can use the uparrow to get back to the last line of code, which you can then modify!
  CorrectAnswer: do(10)*(mean(sample(bigtrees)))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='do(10)*(mean(sample(bigtrees)))')
  Hint: No need to change much - do(10)*(mean(sample(bigtrees)))

- Class: mult_question
  Output: You got 10 of the same number... why is that?
  AnswerChoices: The mean is always the same, because sample simply changes the order of the numbers, but keeps them all;Nick is an amateur and wrote the code incorrectly so it doesn't work;The mean was computed for just one resample
  CorrectAnswer: The mean is always the same, because sample simply changes the order of the numbers, but keeps them all
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='The mean is always the same, because sample simply changes the order of the numbers, but keeps them all')
  Hint: The do loop still ran and sampled 10 times, so what else could it be? Don't hurt my feelings, either. 

- Class: text
  Output: Right - using sample, we just reordered all of the numbers so the mean was the same each time. You may not realize it, but you've just acquired a skill that will let you quantify uncertainty in your estimates of many population parameters (e.g., population means, proportions, correlation coefficients, etc).
