  Lesson: 3.3 - Sample and resample

- Class: figure
  Output: In this section, we're going to look at our two sampling functions, sample() and resample(). These functions can be used on both data frames and groups of raw numbers, and we'll try these functions out on both.
  Figure: cereal.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: To illustrate the difference between these functions, let's generate some numbers to try our sampling functions on. Enter - exampleNumbers<-seq(0,100,5)
  CorrectAnswer: exampleNumbers<-seq(0,100,5)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='exampleNumbers<-seq(0,100,5)', strict=FALSE)
  Hint: Enter - exampleNumbers<-seq(0,100,5)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: The seq() function creates a sequence of numbers - from a first number, to a second number, in increments of a third number. So our new object, exampleNumbers, goes from 0 to 100 by 5. Just to see what it looks like, enter exampleNumbers in the console and press Enter.
  CorrectAnswer: exampleNumbers
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='exampleNumbers')
  Hint: Typing in the name of an object (all of your objects are in your workspace - the upper right hand corner) will show us what it is. So, just type exampleNumbers and press Enter. 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: The key difference between sample() and resample(), is that the former samples WITHOUT replacement, and the latter samples WITH replacement. This means that as soon as something is chosen in a sample(), it is removed from the population and cannot be chosen again. We can demonstrate this pretty easily by sampling our exampleNumbers. Try it - sample(exampleNumbers)
  CorrectAnswer: sample(exampleNumbers)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='sample(exampleNumbers)')
  Hint: Enter - sample(exampleNumbers

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: It's mixed up, but each number that we started with is still there. Let's try it again using resample instead!  One quick tip - you can hit the uparrow and then add a 're' before sample to get resample(exampleNumbers).
  CorrectAnswer: resample(exampleNumbers)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='resample(exampleNumbers)')
  Hint: Last time we used sample(exampleNumbers). This time, we use resample(exampleNumbers).

- Class: text
  Output: This time, while we still have 21 individual numbers, some are repeated and some are left out. This distinction will become important when we eventually learn about bootstrapping!

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: sample() and resample() work the same way on data frames as they do on groups of numbers. When a row is selected with sample(), it cannot be selected again (but it can with resample). Try it out on our Cereal data frame - sample(Cereal).  Pay particular notice to the last column, which shows you the row of the original dataframe that each observation came from.
  CorrectAnswer: sample(Cereal)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='sample(Cereal)')
  Hint: Enter - sample(Cereal)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now, for comparison, try out resample(Cereal).  Again, consider using the uparrow to get to the last thing you entered, which you can then modify by adding `re' (in front of sample)
  CorrectAnswer: resample(Cereal)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='resample(Cereal)')
  Hint: Enter - resample(Cereal)

- Class: text
  Output: Whereas sample() produced a permuted version of the same data frame, resample() actually includes several cases multiple times while leaving other cases out! You'll learn why this matters this week in lecture.
