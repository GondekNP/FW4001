  Lesson: 2.4 - Side-by-side plots
  Author: Nick Gondek and John Fieberg
  Type: Standard
  Organization: University of Minnesota
  Version: 2.4.2


- Class: figure
  Output: In the two previous sections, we learned how to compare both categorical and quantitative variables using another variable. For example, we looked at the differences in number of piercings between males and females, or the desire to win certain awards between males and females.
  Figure: student.R
  FigureType: new
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Just like the last few lessons, I've put the dataset "StudentSurvey" into your workspace. Click on the name of this dataset in order to inspect the variables - you probably know most of them by now!
  CorrectAnswer: View(StudentSurvey)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='View(StudentSurvey)')
  Hint: No need to type anything into the console - just click on StudentSurvey in the upper right panel.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's take a look at a graph we generated in Pre-lab 2.2. This one compared the desire to win certain awards by Gender. Enter this code into the console - bargraph(~Award, data=StudentSurvey, groups = Gender, auto.key=TRUE).
  CorrectAnswer: bargraph(~Award, data=StudentSurvey, groups = Gender, auto.key=TRUE)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='bargraph(~Award, data=StudentSurvey, groups = Gender, auto.key=TRUE)')
  Hint: Make sure you use the ~ before Award! Enter bargraph(~Award, data=StudentSurvey, groups = Gender, auto.key=TRUE)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: You'll see that males and females are represented by different colors in this graph. There is, however, another way to visualize this - a side by side plot, where there are essentially TWO (or more) plots next to one another, each looking at a different group. To convert this plot into a side-by-side, we enter this code - bargraph(~Award|Gender, data=StudentSurvey, auto.key=TRUE). Don't copy and paste! Look for where the | symbol is on your keyboard. 
  CorrectAnswer: bargraph(~Award|Gender, data=StudentSurvey, auto.key=TRUE)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='bargraph(~Award|Gender, data=StudentSurvey, auto.key=TRUE)')
  Hint: Make sure you've got a ~ before Award, and a | symbol between Award and Gender. Enter - bargraph(~Award|Gender, data=StudentSurvey, auto.key=TRUE)

- Class: text
  Output: Now we've got a plot that puts these two groups next to one another, instead of split by color. One might be preferable over the other depending on the nature of your question, so it's good to know how to do both!

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Splitting this up in different plots as opposed to color works the same way for densityplot() as it does for bargraph(). Try to modify the code we used in 2.3 - densityplot(~Piercings, data=StudentSurvey, groups=Gender, auto.key = TRUE) - to generate side-by-side plots instead of a color-coded one. Remember to use the | symbol!
  CorrectAnswer: densityplot(~Piercings|Gender, data=StudentSurvey, auto.key = TRUE)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='densityplot(~Piercings|Gender, data=StudentSurvey, auto.key = TRUE)')
  Hint: Just like in the previous example, we need to do two things. 1- We need to get rid of the groups=Gender argument (just delete it, and the comma after it). 2- We need to add |Gender directly after Piercings. Try it again, and try looking at the code from the previous question for an example!
