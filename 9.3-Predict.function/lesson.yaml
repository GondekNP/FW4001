- Class: text
  Output: Welcome to Pre-lab 9.3. This will be a short lab illustrating the use of the predict function with a fitted linear model. 

- Class: figure
  Output: Lets revisit our model relating temperature change to meal size in rattlesnakes.
  Figure: rattle2.R
  FigureType: new
   
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "OK, lets look again at the summary of our fitted model.  Type: summary(snake.lm)" 
  CorrectAnswer: summary(snake.lm)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='summary(snake.lm)')
  Hint: Enter -  summary(snake.lm)

- Class: text
  Output: "We can predict the temperature when a rattlesnake eats a meal of size = 20 units by plugging and chugging: 0.32+0.027*20 =0.86.  Or, we could use the predict function.  In this lab, we will see how to use the predict function." 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We can get a confidence interval for the AVERAGE temperature change following a meal of size 20 units using - predict(snake.lm, newdata=data.frame(meal.size=20), interval="confidence").  Try it!
  CorrectAnswer: predict(snake.lm, newdata=data.frame(meal.size=20),interval=\"confidence\") 
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='predict(snake.lm, newdata=data.frame(meal.size=20),interval=\"confidence\")')
  Hint: Enter -  predict(snake.lm, newdata=data.frame(meal.size=20),interval="confidence")
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We can get a prediction interval for a NEW OBSERVATION  following a meal of size 20 units using-  predict(snake.lm, newdata=data.frame(meal.size=20), interval="prediction").  Try it!
  CorrectAnswer: predict(snake.lm, newdata=data.frame(meal.size=20),interval=\"prediction\") 
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='predict(snake.lm, newdata=data.frame(meal.size=20),interval=\"prediction\")')
  Hint: Enter -  predict(snake.lm, newdata=data.frame(meal.size=20),interval="prediction")
  

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Which is larger? Why?
  AnswerChoices: confidence interval since we need to be confident in our answer;  prediction interval since we must account for uncertainty in the true line as well as variation about the line
  CorrectAnswer: prediction interval since we must account for uncertainty in the true line as well as variation about the line
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='prediction interval since we must account for uncertainty in the true line as well as variation about the line')
  Hint: Look at the arguments in the help file

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Lastly, we can visualize confidence bands and prediction bands (i.e. confidence and prediction intervals for the full range of meal sizes in our data) using:  xyplot(temp.change~meal.size, data=Rattlesnakes, panel=panel.lmbands). Try it!"
  CorrectAnswer:  xyplot(temp.change~meal.size, data=Rattlesnakes, panel=panel.lmbands)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='xyplot(temp.change~meal.size, data=Rattlesnakes, panel=panel.lmbands)')
  Hint: Enter -   xyplot(temp.change~meal.size, data=Rattlesnakes, panel=panel.lmbands)

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Which set of lines gives use prediction intervals?
  AnswerChoices: blue; pink; green
  CorrectAnswer: pink
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='pink')
  Hint: Which interval is bigger, prediction or confidence interval?
    
- Class: text
  Output: Yes.  Confidence intervals/bands only account for our uncertainty regarding the best fit line. By contrast, prediction intervals/bands capture uncertainty associated with the best-fit line, but also the variation about the line. Notice how prediction bands cover encompass nearly all of the data!
