- Class: text
  Output: Welcome to Pre-lab 9.3. This will be a short lab illustrating the use of the predict function with a fitted linear model. 

- Class: figure
  Output: Lets revisit our model relating temperature change to meal size in rattlesnakes.
  Figure: rattle2.R

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "OK, lets look again at the summary of our fitted model.  Type: summary(snake.lm)" 
  CorrectAnswer: summary(snake.lm)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='summary(snake.lm)')
  Hint: Enter -  summary(snake.lm)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "We can predict the temperature when a rattlesnake eats a meal of size = 20 units by plugging and chugging: 0.32+0.027*20 =0.86.  Or, we could use the predict.lm function.  Lets take a look at this function by typing: ?predict.lm" 
  CorrectAnswer: ?predict.lm 
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='?predict.lm')
  Hint: Enter -  ?predict.lm
    
- Class: mult_question
  Output: What argument of this function do we need to specify in order to get an estimate of the SE associated with our prediction?
  AnswerChoices: se.fit; se; se.true; se.give.me.it
  CorrectAnswer: se.fit
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='se.fit')
  Hint: Look at the arguments in the help file
  

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "We can get a confidence interval for the AVERAGE temperature change following a meal of size 20 units using:predict(snake.lm, newdata=data.frame(meal.size=20), interval=\"confidence\")".  Try it!" 
  CorrectAnswer: predict(snake.lm, newdata=data.frame(meal.size=20),interval=\"confidence\") 
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='predict(snake.lm, newdata=data.frame(meal.size=20),interval=\"confidence\")')
  Hint: Enter -  predict(snake.lm, newdata=data.frame(meal.size=20),interval="confidence")
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "We can get a prediction interval for a NEW OBSERVATION  following a meal of size 20 units using:predict(snake.lm, newdata=data.frame(meal.size=20), interval=\"prediction\")".  Try it!" 
  CorrectAnswer: predict(snake.lm, newdata=data.frame(meal.size=20),interval=\"prediction\") 
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='predict(snake.lm, newdata=data.frame(meal.size=20),interval=\"prediction\")')
  Hint: Enter -  predict(snake.lm, newdata=data.frame(meal.size=20),interval="prediction")
  

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Which is larger? Why?
  AnswerChoices: confidence interval since we need to be confident in our answer;  prediction interval since we must account for uncertainty in the true line as well as variation about the line
  CorrectAnswer: prediction interval since we must account for uncertainty in the true line as well as variation about the line
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='prediction interval since we must account for uncertainty in the true line as well as variation about the line')
  Hint: Look at the arguments in the help file
