- Class: text
  Output: So, we know how to calculate confidence intervals using both simulation (bootstrapping) and formulas. Let's do both on a given dataset, and see how they compare to one another.

- Class: figure
  Output: Every Fourth of July, Nathan's Famous in New York City holds a hot dog eating contest, in which contestants try to eat as many hot dogs (with buns) as possible in ten minutes. The data set HotDogs contains the winning number of hot dogs for each year from 2002-2011.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: I've loaded this dataset into R from the Lock5Package.  Lets take a look at this dataset by clicking on it in the upper rigth panel.
  CorrectAnswer: View(HotDogs)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='View(HotDogs)')
  Hint: You can also type View(HotDogs) with a capitol V

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's first create a bootstrap distribution for the mean number of hot dogs needed to win the contest (in this case, our parameter is the "population mean" or, the average number of hot dogs need to win if you looked at ALL past and future years of the contest). Try it now, enter - Bootdat<-do(1000)*{mean(~HotDogs, data=resample(HotDogs))}.
  CorrectAnswer: Bootdat<-do(1000)*{mean(~HotDogs, data=resample(HotDogs))}
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='Bootdat<-do(1000)*{mean(~HotDogs, data=resample(HotDogs))}')
  Hint: Type Bootdat<-do(1000)*{mean(~HotDogs, data=resample(HotDogs))}

- Class: cmd_question
  Output:  Lets look at our bootstrap means using the head function.
  CorrectAnswer: head(Bootdat)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='head(Bootdat)')
  Hint: Enter - head(Bootdat)
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now, let's get a confidence interval using the qdata functon - bootCI<-qdata(~result, p=c(.025,0.975), data=Bootdat)
  CorrectAnswer: bootCI<-qdata(~result, p=c(.025,0.975), data=Bootdat)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='bootCI<-qdata(~result, p=c(.025,0.975), data=Bootdat)')
  Hint: Enter - bootCI<-qdata(~result, p=c(.025,0.975), data=Bootdat)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Lets look at our interval by typing - bootCI
  CorrectAnswer: bootCI
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='bootCI')
  Hint: Enter - bootCI

- Class: text
  Output: So, using a bootstrapping simulation method, we got a 95% confidence interval of approximately (52, 60). We are 95% sure that the mean number of hotdogs needed to win the contest is between 52 and  60! Thats a lot of hot dogs!

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now, let's try it again using the explicit formula for calculating a confidence interval for a mean. This can be found on your formula sheet, but here it is, sample mean +/- t* x SE, where SE = s / sqrt(n).  Note, s is the standard deviation of the data. So, to calculate this interval, we need to first calculate the SE.  Lets calculate and store this value by entering the following - formSE <- sd(~HotDogs, data=HotDogs)/sqrt(10) (since there are 10 cases in the dataframe).
  CorrectAnswer: formSE <- sd(~HotDogs, data=HotDogs)/sqrt(10)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='formSE <- sd(~HotDogs, data=HotDogs)/sqrt(10)')
  Hint: Enter - formSE <- sd(~HotDogs, data=HotDogs)/sqrt(10)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We need two more things to make a confidence interval. We need the mean number of hotdogs in our sample data and the t* for a 95% confidence interval. Let's get the mean first - call it formMean (for formula mean), formMean<-mean(~HotDogs, data=HotDogs).
  CorrectAnswer: formMean <- mean(~HotDogs, data=HotDogs)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='formMean <- mean(~HotDogs, data=HotDogs)')
  Hint: Enter - formMean <- mean(~HotDogs, data=HotDogs)

- Class: exact_question
  Output: Lastly, we need a t* value for our 95% confidence interval. If df = n-1, how many degrees of freedom should our t-distribution have?
  CorrectAnswer: 9
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='9')
  Hint: Remember, n=10 (and df = n-1). 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Exactly. So, we can get t* (and store it in an object called tstars) by using the xqt function as follows - tstars <- xqt(p=c(.025, .975), df=9)
  CorrectAnswer: tstars <- xqt(p=c(.025, .975), df=9)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='tstars <- xqt(p=c(.025, .975), df=9)')
  Hint: Enter -  tstars <- xqt(p=c(.025, .975), df=9)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's put it all together to see our formula-produced confidence interval. Try it out now - formCI <- formMean + tstars*formSE
  CorrectAnswer: formCI <- formMean + tstars*formSE
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='formCI <- formMean + tstars*formSE')
  Hint: Enter - formCI <- formMean + tstars*formSE

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's print this interval to take a look. Enter - formCI
  CorrectAnswer: formCI
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='formCI')
  Hint: Enter - formCI

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now, let's print out our boostrap confidence interval - bootCI.
  CorrectAnswer: bootCI
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='bootCI')
  Hint: Enter - bootCI

- Class: mult_question
  Output: What do you notice about these two intervals?
  AnswerChoices: The bootstrap interval is much bigger;The formula interval is much bigger;They're about the same
  CorrectAnswer: They're about the same
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='They\'re about the same')
  Hint: They are not exactly the same, but they are awfully close.  When you get up near 50 hotdogs, another 1/3 of a hotdog doesn't matter all that much does it?

- Class: text
  Output: As long as our sample size is big enough, OR our data is approximately normal, these intervals should be pretty similar. The formula version has the benefit of not needing any computation, but the bootstrap version is more flexible.
