  Output: So, we know how to calculate confidence intervals using both simulation (bootstrapping) and formulas. Let's do both on a given dataset, and see how they compare to one another.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's use an aribitrary set of numbers to illustrate this point. I've put a group of 20 numbers in your workspace, an object called j. We'll first create a bootstrap distribution of means for these twenty numbers. Try it now, simulating 1000 bootstrap means with a do loop and the resample function.
  CorrectAnswer: do(1000)*{mean(resample(j))}
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='do(1000)*{mean(resample(j))}')
  Hint: Use the following format - do(numberOfSims)*{mean(resample(numbers))}

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now, let's get a confidence interval using the qdata functon - bootCI<-qdata(~result, p=c(.025,.975), data=jmeans)
  CorrectAnswer: bootCI <- data(~result, p=c(.025,.975), data=jmeans)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='bootCI <- data(~result, p=c(.025,.975), data=jmeans)')
  Hint: Enter - bootCI <- data(~result, p=c(.025,.975), data=jmeans)

- Class: text
  Output: So, using a bootstrapping simulation method, we got a 95% confidence interval of (9.26, 10.70).

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now, let's try it again using the explicit formula for calculating a confidence interval for a mean. This can be found on your formula sheet, but here it is - SE = s / sqrt(n), where s is the standard deviation of the data. So, to calculate this value, we need to enter the following - formSE <- sd(j)/sqrt(20)
  CorrectAnswer: formSE <- sd(j)/sqrt(20)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='formSE <- sd(j)/sqrt(20)')
  Hint: Enter - formSE <- sd(j)/sqrt(20)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We need two more things to make a confidence interval - mean and the t* for a 95% confidence interval. Let's get the mean first - call it formMean.
  CorrectAnswer: formMean <- mean(j)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='formMean <- mean(j)')
  Hint: Enter - formMean <- mean(j)

- Class: exact_question
  Output: Lastly, we need a t* value for our 95% confidence interval. If df = n-1, how many degrees of freedom should our t-distribution have?
  CorrectAnswer: 19
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='formMean <- mean(j)')
  Hint: Remember, n=20. 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Exactly. So, we can get t* by using the qt function as follows - tstars <- qt(c(.025, .975), df=19)
  CorrectAnswer: tstars <- qt(c(.025, .975), df=19)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='tstars <- qt(c(.025, .975), df=19)')
  Hint: Enter -  tstars <- qt(c(.025, .975), df=19)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's put it all together to see our formula-produced confidence interval. Try it out now - formCI <- formMean + tstars*formSE
  CorrectAnswer: formCI <- formMean + tstars*formSE
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='formCI <- formMean + tstars*formSE')
  Hint: Enter - formCI <- formMean + tstars*formSE

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's print this interval to take a look. Enter - formCI
  CorrectAnswer: formCI
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='formCI')
  Hint: Enter - formCI

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now, let's print out our boostrap confidence interval - bootCI.
  CorrectAnswer: bootCI
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='bootCI')
  Hint: Enter - bootCI

- Class: mult_question
  Output: What do you notice about these two intervals?
  AnswerChoices: The bootstrap interval is much bigger;The formula interval is much bigger;They're about the same
  CorrectAnswer: They're about the same
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='They\'re about the same')
  Hint: They're not exactly the same, but they're awfully close.

- Class: text
  Output: As long as our sample size is big enough, OR our data is approximately normal, these intervals should be pretty similar. The formula version has the benefit of not needing any computation, but the bootstrap version is more flexible.
