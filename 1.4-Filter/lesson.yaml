- Class: text
  Output: Almost done with Pre-lab 1! In the last section, we learned how to take the mean, max and min of some sales data. In this section, we'll use the filter function to manipulate our data. 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's say that, for some reason, we only want to look at data from 2007. We can use the function filter() to filter out all of the years we don't want! Try it now using this code - filter(RetailSales, Year==2007)
  CorrectAnswer: filter(RetailSales, Year==2007)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='filter(RetailSales, Year==2007)')
  Hint: Using the code - filter(RetailSales, Year==2007) - we are telling R to filter the RetailSales dataset, and only select Years that are equal to 2007.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: You'll see that R printed only the year 2007 on the console! This isn't specific to Year, we can do this with the Month variable too. Let's try it with December - filter(RetailSales, Month=='Dec')
  CorrectAnswer: filter(RetailSales, Month=='Dec')
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('filter(RetailSales, Month==\'Dec\')', 'filter(RetailSales, Month==\"Dec\")')
  Hint: It looks similar to the last, except that instead of looking for the year 2007, we're looking for the month of December - filter(RetailSales, Month=='Dec')

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now your turn - filter our dataset RetailSales for the month of May, using the same format from the last prompt!
  CorrectAnswer: filter(RetailSales, Month=='May')
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('filter(RetailSales, Month==\'May\')', 'filter(RetailSales, Month==\"May\")')
  Hint: The code is going to look *very* similar to the last prompt, in which we chose the month of december. All we need to do is change 'Dec' to 'May'!

- Class: text
  Output: Great work! Using filter, we can chose specific rows of data from a dataset - you'll use this for analysis purposes in lab.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Good work! You've completed Pre-Lab 1.4. Please select "YES" (or "No"). Either will allow you to submit the log of this lesson to Google Forms so that I can give you credit for the pre-lab assignment.
