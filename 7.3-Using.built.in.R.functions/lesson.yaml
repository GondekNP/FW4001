  Lesson: 7.3- Using built in R functions
  Author: John Fieberg and Nick Gondek
  Type: Standard
  Organization: University of Minnesota
  Version: 2.4.2

- Class: text
  Output: In this lesson, we will explore built functions in R for conducting hypothesis tests involving differences in means and differences in proportions. 

- Class: figure
  Output: Lets consider the HornedLizards data from class and homeowrk. I have loaded them for you (as you will see in the upper right panel)
  Figure: hliz.R
  FigureType: new
  
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: I have loaded this dataset into R from the abd package.  Lets take a look at this dataset by clicking on it in the upper right panel.
  CorrectAnswer: View(HornedLizards)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='View(HornedLizards)')
  Hint: You can also type View(HornedLizards) with a capitol V

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "We can use the t.test function to test for a difference in mean horn length among lizards that have been killed and those that are alive.  Lets look at the help function for for t.test by typing ?stats::t.test"
  CorrectAnswer: ?stats::t.test
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='?stats::t.test')
  Hint: "Type ?stats::t.test"

- Class: mult_question
  Output: What does the conf.level argument do?
  AnswerChoices: It builds the users confidence;It allows the user to specify a level of confidence for a confidence interval; something else that is probably pretty cool
  CorrectAnswer: It allows the user to specify a level of confidence for a confidence interval
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='It allows the user to specify a level of confidence for a confidence interval')
  Hint: Really?  You need a hint for this one?

- Class: cmd_question
  Output:  "That is right.  t.test will conduct a hypothesis test AND give us confidence interval for the difference in means. OK, tests try it out by typing: t.test(horn.length~group, data=HornedLizards)"
  CorrectAnswer: t.test(horn.length~group, data=HornedLizards)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='t.test(horn.length~group, data=HornedLizards)')
  Hint: Enter t.test(horn.length~group, data=HornedLizards)
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Is the result statistically significant using an alpha= 0.05?
  AnswerChoices: Yes;No
  CorrectAnswer: Yes
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Yes')
  Hint: Is the p-value small?  Is 0 in the confidence interval?

- Class: mult_question
  Output: What do we have to assume about our data?
  AnswerChoices: The data are normally distributed; We have a large sample size (more than 30 in each group);The data are normally distributed AND we have a large sample size (more than 30 in each group); The data are normally distributed OR We have a large sample size (more than 30 in each group); Nothing;
  CorrectAnswer: The data are normally distributed OR We have a large sample size (more than 30 in each group)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='The data are normally distributed OR We have a large sample size (more than 30 in each group)')
  Hint: For small sample sizes, we need normal data.  If sample sizes are large, then we are "OK" because of the central limit theorem.

- Class: text
  Output: If we have paired data, then we need to use the paired=TRUE argument in t.test. To illustrate, lets consider an example from Whitlock and Schluter.
  
  
- Class: text
  Output: Example 12.2 So macho it makes you sick? (verbatim from Whitlock and Schluter ) 
    In many species, males are more likely to attract females if the males have high testosterone
    levels. Are males with high testosterone paying for this extra mating success in other ways? One
    hypothesis is that males with high testosterone might be less able to fight off disease – that is, their
    high levels of testosterone might reduce their immunocompetence. To test this idea Hasselquist
    et al. (1999) experimentally increased the testosterone levels of 13 male and female red-winged
    blackbirds by implanting a small permeable tube filled with testosterone. They measured the
    antibody levels in each bird’s blood serum both before and after the implant. The antibody levels
    were measured optically, in units of log 10−3 optical density per minute (ln[mOD/min]).
    

- Class: figure
  Output: These data are again contained in the abd library. I have loaded them for you (as you will see in the upper right panel)
  Figure: blackb.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Lets look at these data by clicking on them in the upper right panel.
  CorrectAnswer: View(Blackbirds)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='View(Blackbirds)')
  Hint: You can also type View(Blackbirds) with a capitol V

- Class: cmd_question
  Output:  "OK, lets try it out by typing: t.test(x=Blackbirds$log.after, y=Blackbirds$log.before, paired=TRUE)"
  CorrectAnswer: t.test(x=Blackbirds$log.after, y=Blackbirds$log.before, paired=TRUE)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='t.test(x=Blackbirds$log.after, y=Blackbirds$log.before, paired=TRUE)')
  Hint: Enter t.test(x=Blackbirds$log.after, y=Blackbirds$log.before, paired=TRUE)
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Is the result statistically significant using an alpha= 0.05?
  AnswerChoices: Yes;No
  CorrectAnswer: No
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='No')
  Hint: Is the p-value small?  Is 0 in the confidence interval?

- Class: text
  Output: Lastly, lets look at an example using prop.test.  For this example, lets consider the StudentSurvey dataset again.  Lets
    ask if more males or females smoke?

- Class: figure
  Output: I have loaded the data for you from the Lock5Data library (as you will see in the upper right panel)
  Figure: student.R
  FigureType: new
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output:  "OK, lests try it out by typing: prop.test(Gender~Smoke, data=StudentSurvey)"
  CorrectAnswer: prop.test(Gender~Smoke, data=StudentSurvey)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='prop.test(Gender~Smoke, data=StudentSurvey)')
  Hint: Enter prop.test(Gender~Smoke, data=StudentSurvey)
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Is the result statistically significant using an alpha= 0.05?
  AnswerChoices: Yes;No
  CorrectAnswer: No
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='No')
  Hint: Is the p-value small?  Is 0 in the confidence interval?
