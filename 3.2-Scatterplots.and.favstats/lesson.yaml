- Class: figure
  Output: Now that we've looked at visualizing one quantitative and one categorical variable together (using a box-and-whisker plot, or boxplot), we are going to look at how we can do exploratory data analysis on solely quantitative data.
  Figure: cereal.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We're going to take another look at the nutritional contents of breakfast cereal (the 'Cereal' dataset in Lock5Data). Use the head() function to get a quick look at this dataset!
  CorrectAnswer: head(Cereal)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='head(Cereal)')
  Hint: We can look in the workspace (upper right pane) to see what the data is called - in this case, it's called Cereal. All we need to do is put that word inside of the head() function. Enter - head(Cereal)

- Class: text
  Output: There are all sorts of statistics you can use for quantatitive data, and you've seen many of them already. Think max, mean, median, mode, standard deviation, etc.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Often, when we are exploring our data, we don't really know what statistics we want to look at. Fortunately, the mosaic package gives us a great function that gives us a summary of some quantitative data - favstats(). Rather than explain how this works, let's just try it on an example and see. Try it out on the Carbs variable in our dataset - favstats(~Carbs, data=Cereal)
  CorrectAnswer: favstats(~Carbs, data=Cereal)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='favstats(~Carbs, data=Cereal)')
  Hint: Enter - favstats(~Carbs, data=Cereal)

- Class: exact_question
  Output: You'll see that R prints out many useful statistics that you've seen already, without you having to go through the legwork of getting each one individually. Now, based on this output - What is the mean grams of Carbs per serving in the dataset (rounded to two decimal places)?
  CorrectAnswer: 29.67
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=29.67)
  Hint: Look right underneath mean in the favstats() output.

- Class: exact_question
  Output: How many of the cereals in our dataset have a 48 grams of Carbs per serving or more?
  CorrectAnswer: 0
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=0)
  Hint: It might seem like you need more info to answer this question, but you actually don't! What does the output of favstats say for the MAXIMUM (max) number of grams per serving of carbs? You can use that information to answer this question - How many cereals have 48 or more grams of Carbs?

- Class: text
  Output: Tricky question - since we know that the highest grams per serving of Carbs in our dataset is 47, we have exactly zero cereals with 48 or more grams per serving!

- Class: text
  Output: Favstats is useful for looking at a single quantatitive variable, but what if we want to look at two different quantitative variables against one another? For example, are more sugary cereals higher in calories?

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: In this situation, a quick way to visualize the data would be to use a scatterplot (or an xy-plot, as some call it). Try it now using our above example - xyplot(Sugars~Calories, data=Cereal)
  CorrectAnswer: xyplot(Sugars~Calories, data=Cereal)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('xyplot(Sugars~Calories, data=Cereal)', 'xyplot(Calories~Sugar, data=Cereal)')
  Hint: Enter - xyplot(Sugars~Calories, data=Cereal)
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Looking at this graph, what can we say about the relationship between Sugars and Calories in this dataset?
  AnswerChoices: There is a generally positive relationship;There is no relationship;There is a generally negative relationship
  CorrectAnswer: There is a generally positive relationship
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= 'There is a generally positive relationship')
  Hint: When one goes up, what happens to the other? If they both go up together, it's a positive relationship. If they're inverse, its a negative relationship.

- Class: text
  Output: Right. We can't say anything definitively yet without using linear regression (which you'll learn about later on), but we can at least say that there is a relationship between these two variables.

- Class: figure
  Output: Good work! You've completed Pre-Lab 3.2. An 8-digit code will appear in the console below - enter this code into the appropriate quiz on moodle in order to receive credit.
