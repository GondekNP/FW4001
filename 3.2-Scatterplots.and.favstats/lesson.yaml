  Lesson: 3.2 - Scatterplots and favstats
  Author: Nick Gondek and John Fieberg
  Type: Standard
  Organization: University of Minnesota
  Version: 2.4.2

- Class: figure
  Output: In the previous lesson, we used a box-and-whisker plot (or boxplot) to visualize one quantitative and one categorical variable together. In this lesson, we are going to continue to look at exploratory data analysis tools for quantitative data (one and two variables).
  Figure: cereal.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We're going to take another look at the nutritional contents of breakfast cereal (the 'Cereal' dataset in Lock5Data). Use the head() function to get a quick look at this dataset!
  CorrectAnswer: head(Cereal)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='head(Cereal)')
  Hint: We can look in the workspace (upper right pane) to see what the data is called - in this case, it's called Cereal. All we need to do is put that word inside of the head() function. Enter - head(Cereal)

- Class: text
  Output: There are all sorts of statistics you can use to summarize quantatitive data.  You've seen several of these already - think max, mean, median, mode, standard deviation, etc.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Oftentimes, we may want to look at several of these statistics all at once.  Fortunately, the mosaic package gives us a great function that will do this for us - favstats(). Rather than explain how this works, let's just try it on an example and see how it works. Try it out on the Carbs variable in our dataset - favstats(~Carbs, data=Cereal)
  CorrectAnswer: favstats(~Carbs, data=Cereal)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='favstats(~Carbs, data=Cereal)')
  Hint: Enter - favstats(~Carbs, data=Cereal)

- Class: exact_question
  Output: You'll see that R prints out many useful statistics that you've seen already, without you having to go through the legwork of getting each one individually. Now, based on this output - What is the mean grams of Carbs per serving in the dataset (rounded to two decimal places)?
  CorrectAnswer: 29.67
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=29.67)
  Hint: Look right underneath mean in the favstats() output.

- Class: exact_question
  Output: How many of the cereals in our dataset have a 48 grams of Carbs per serving or more?
  CorrectAnswer: 0
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=0)
  Hint: It might seem like you need more info to answer this question, but you actually don't! What does the output of favstats say for the MAXIMUM (max) number of grams per serving of carbs? You can use that information to answer this question - How many cereals have 48 or more grams of Carbs?

- Class: text
  Output: Tricky question - since we know that the highest grams per serving of Carbs in our dataset is 47, we have exactly zero cereals with 48 or more grams per serving!

- Class: text
  Output: Favstats is useful for looking at a single quantatitive variable, but what if we want to look at the relationship between two different quantitative variables? For example, what if we want to know whether sugary cereals are also higher in calories?

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: In this situation, a quick way to visualize the data would be to use a scatterplot (or an xy-plot, as some call it). Try it now using our above example - xyplot(Sugars~Calories, data=Cereal)
  CorrectAnswer: xyplot(Sugars~Calories, data=Cereal)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('xyplot(Sugars~Calories, data=Cereal)', 'xyplot(Calories~Sugar, data=Cereal)')
  Hint: Enter - xyplot(Sugars~Calories, data=Cereal)
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Looking at this graph, what can we say about the relationship between Sugars and Calories in this dataset?
  AnswerChoices: Sugars and Calories are postively associated;There is no relationship between Sugars and Calories;Sugars and Calories are negatively associated
  CorrectAnswer: There is a generally positive relationship
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= 'Sugars and Calories are postively associated')
  Hint: â€¢ A positive association means that values of one variable tend to be higher when values of the other variable are higher. A negative association means that values of one variable tend to be lower when values of the other variable are higher.W Two variables are not associated if knowing the value of one variable does not give you any information about the value of the other variable

- Class: text
  Output: Right. We'll learn later on how to determine if the correlation between variables is statistical significant.  For now, however, we can at least say that there is a positive association between these two variables.
