- Class: text
  Output: Welcome to Pre-Lab 2. In this section, we'll practice picking out the difference between categorical and quantitative variables using an example data set from Lock5Data. 

- Class: text
  Output: Let's recall the definiton of a categorical variable. A categorical variable divides each case into a distinct category, or group, with no grey area in between. For example, an animal is either live OR dead. A tree is either spruce OR fir OR pine. The number of groups does not matter, but they are discrete.

  Output: On the other hand, a quantitative variable measures or records a quantity for each case. For example, the age of a person is 32. The height of the sears tower is 1,729 feet. These variables exist on a spectrum - there are many ages less than 35, and many buildings shorter than 1,729 feet.

  Output: For this pre-lab, we will use student survey data (collected by the author of Unlocking the Power of Data) to explore categorical and quantitative data.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: I've put the dataset "StudentSurvey" into your workspace (the upper right panel). Let's click on the name of this dataset in order to take a look. 
  CorrectAnswer: View(StudentSurvey)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='View(StudentSurvey)')
  Hint: No need to type anything into the console - just click on StudentSurvey in the upper right panel. 

- Class: text
  Output: Leave this data set open, because I'll be asking you to identify a few variables as either categorical or quantitative. 

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Let's start with an easy one - is the variable 'Smoke' (which denotes whether the student is a smoker or not) categorical or quantitative?
  AnswerChoices: categorical;quantitative
  CorrectAnswer: categorical
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='categorical')
  Hint: Since there are only two discrete categories this could faill into (either a smoker or a nonsmoker), this is a categorical variable.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: How about the variable 'Weight'?
  AnswerChoices: quantitative;categorical
  CorrectAnswer: quantitative
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='quantitative')
  Hint: Since this is recorded as a numerical measurement, and there are so many possible weights, we would call this one quantitative. 

- Class: mult_question
  Output: What about the variable "GPA"?
  AnswerChoices: quantitative;categorical
  CorrectAnswer: quantitative
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='quantitative')
  Hint: GPA is recorded as a quantity, so we treat it as a quantitative variable. Even though it's between 0 and 4, it still represents a lot of possible values because it goes down to the hundreths place (eg, 3.70, 2.09, 3.23).
